                <p id="main-paragraph">I am currently 27 years old and live in Jenison MI. I grew up in Naperville, IL where I lived a majority of my life. Michigan State is where I went to college and I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Construction Management 
                background. After I graduated I moved down to St. Petersburg, Florida and worked for an electrical contractor. At this company I managed highrise electrical projects throughout the Nashville area. These projects included the Hotel Curio Fraye, Grand Hyatt, Sixth South,
                and many others. I am also currently married and we have a 12 year old labruahua. Yes you heard that right she is half chiuahua and half lab. Everyone who sees her believes that she is a puppy instead of a spry old girl. A fun fact about me is that I was born in the city of Rancho Cucamonga, California. Besides the cool name of the city this was also where the movie
                Friday was filmed.

                <p id="main-paragraph"> There are a lot of reasons I would like to become a web developer. The first major reason is because I love to problem solve. Currently in my industry and profession I do alot of problem solving. The idea of being able to do a bunch of problem solving using
                    my computer skills excites me in this field. It also excites me that I have the ability to be as creative as possible in this field of web development. With this class I am looking to potentially change my profession from a project manger in the construction field to move into either a 
                    program management role or even a developer role. Unlike most industries web development is something that is always evolving with new technology and you are able to be on the cutting edge of the newest technology. I chose Coding Temple after reading the great 
                    reviews from past alumni. All of them for the most part spoke very highly about this course. They also mentioned how the mentors are there to grow and work with you on any questions you have. Overall, I am very excited to start my new career path in web development
                    using the building blocks I will learn from Coding Temple.
